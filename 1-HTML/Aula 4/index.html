    I went to our house in the country with my Family. It’s a small house in a village in the mountains. We often go there at the weekends and we usually go there for a few weeks in the summer. It was really hot when we went this weekend. It was 35 degrees. I was surprised because it’s July. It’s usually cold.

    It was my birthday. My boyfriend Daniel came to my house to take me out for dinner. I opened the door, and he had a big bunch of flowers and a very nice car. He rented the car just to take me out. I was really surprised.
