    I went to our house in the <b>country with my Family</b>. It’s a small house <strong>in a village in the mountains</strong>. We often go there at <em>the weekends and we usually</em> go there for a few weeks in the summer. It was really hot when we went this weekend. It was 35 degrees. I was surprised because it’s July. It’s usually cold.

    It was my birthday. My boyfriend Daniel came to my house to take me out for dinner. I opened the door, and he had a big bunch of flowers and a very nice car. He rented the car just to take me out. I was really surprised.
